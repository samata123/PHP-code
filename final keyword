final keyword can be used to prevent class inheritence or to prevent method overriding

<?php
final class Fruit {
  public $name;
  public $color;
 
  public function intro() {
    echo "The fruit is {$this->name} and the color is {$this->color}.";
  }
}

class Strawberry extends Fruit {
  public $weight;
  
  public function intro() {
    echo "The fruit is {$this->name}, the color is {$this->color}, and the weight is {$this->weight} gram.";
  }
}

$strawberry = new Strawberry("Strawberry", "red", 50);
$strawberry->intro();
?>
output:
  Class Strawberry may not inherit from final class (Fruit) in <b>[...][...]
