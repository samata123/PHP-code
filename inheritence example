inheritence is relationship between two classes.
An inherited class is defined by using the extends keyword.

The Strawberry class is inherited from the Fruit class.

This means that the Strawberry class can use the public $name and $color properties as well as the public __construct() and intro() methods from the Fruit class because of inheritance.

The Strawberry class also has its own method: message().

<?php

class Fruit{
    public $name;
    public $color;
    
    public function get_name($name)
    {
       return $this->name=$name;
       
    }
}
class apple extends fruit
{
  public function get_cat()
  {
      echo "cateory is fruits";
  }
}

$apple =new apple();
echo $apple->get_name("apple");
echo "<br/>";
echo $apple ->get_cat();
